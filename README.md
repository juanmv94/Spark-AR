# Meta Spark AR
**Meta Spark** (formerly known as **Spark AR Studio**) was a platform developed by Meta (formerly Facebook) that enabled creators to design, build, and share augmented reality (AR) effects for social media platforms **Instagram**, **Facebook**, and **Messenger**.
It was discontinued on January 14, 2025.
Here is my private GIT repository containing project files and source code for all my filters made since 2019 to 2024, now made public after discontinuation announcement.

Here is a summary video I've made for my first 2019 filters: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HUEw3dAwJc

# My published filters
Here are all my filters that were published on my private Instagram profile **@Juanmv94**, in descending (aproximated) release date

<br/><img align="left" width="60" height="60" src="https://github.com/juanmv94/Spark-AR/blob/main/Instagram/NSFeTracker/icon.png?raw=true">

## NSFeTracker
This is the result of a tech demo I wanted to make for Meta Spark to demonstrate, since IG filters had a size limit of 4Mb for resources, including AAC audio, that an IG filter was also able to generate chiptune music on the fly using script and a compressed JSON with the keynotes. I faced some limitations since on Meta Spark Studio SDK I was only able to generate basic waveforms (square, triangle, sine, noise, and sawtooth) and script logic for Instagram filters updates at most each frame (30 Hz, while the NES runs at 50/60Hz). It includes 17 diferent chiptunes

## QRFace

Imagine being so ugly that you have to cover your face inside a box to avoid disturbing other people. This filter makes you live that experience with ease, making you become the cool guy of the party. From a technical point, this is the first ever IG AR filter that generates QR codes on the fly. That's it, you'll never see the same QR code each time you use the filter, it generates text QR codes with the current time photo/video was recorded. I've also created the [QRCode](#qrcode) public block just after it

LUT filters are one of the most common on Instagram due to it's simplicity to implement for junior AR filter developers. In order not to miss the trend, I made this filter in which you can use not one, but between 14 different LUTs, and not only for your camera but also for your media gallery

## ScannerPro

"Scanner" filters became a trend in the early 2020's, but most of them lacked from pixel interpolation and general quality. In order to make the difference, I decided to make **the best** scanner filter to the moment, not only using a correct pixel interpolation but also allowing users to choose between diferent scanner directions, and speeds

## Construction

Playing Minecraft on AR is now possible! Watch a full "gameplay" of this filter here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxX0zP3heW4

The repository for this project was made public and can be found [here](https://github.com/juanmv94/SparkAR-Construction)

Why did I made this project public? The story begins when a well-known AR creator with millions of followers decided to plagiarize my filter without even hiding it (He even used the same materials in the same order as in my filter). After discovering this plagiarism, I noticed that it also worked very slowly and could not be built beyond an 6x6x6 area. This is understandable since my filters have a technical level that is very difficult to match. Since this poorly made filter was going viral over my original filter, I decided to fight back and bring it to the attention of the SparkAR community by announcing the plagiarism and making my filter public so that anyone could use my well-made original filter

# My un-published filters (otrosTerminados)

Here are some of mi finished filters that were not published to IG since they didn't meet my personal quality criteria, were private people requests, or simply had some specific application outside IG

## Art

This filter uses a shader to make an impressive oil moving effect after tapping the screen

It was not published since the shader had a bad performance on older devices, and it only worked on still images

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2b52e3db-9595-4274-a248-c40d0a8f9a1e

## CyberTruck

This filter places a Tesla Cybertruck on a plane surface

It was not published since it was a very simple filter, and I was not associated in any way with Tesla (I've just made it for fun)

<img src="https://github.com/juanmv94/Spark-AR/blob/main/otrosTerminados/CyberTruck/Captura.PNG?raw=true">

## LCDtv

This filter emulates an LCD subpixel effect

It was not published since it was a very simple filter that didn't show right on low resolution screens

<img src="https://github.com/juanmv94/Spark-AR/blob/main/otrosTerminados/LCDtv/Captura.PNG?raw=true">

## MachuPichu

This filter was a client project mockup that was finally cancelled presumably due to lack of capital to pay for it. The filter would allow you to check how much the silhouette of a person resembles the silhouette of Mount Machu Pichu (Peru), showing the percentage of coincidence.

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/faca1d1e-57fe-495b-a587-69be03c617af

## MascarillaWifon

Just a variation of [MascarillaESP](#mascarillaesp) with wifon.fm logo that was intended to be given to the radio station IG for free during pandemic

## MaxDraw

Simple filter with a shader that always shows the highest RGB value to the time. Useful for making light paintings like the one of the video

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/315d6893-bc30-4a34-ac40-2713a9d70e04

## Pianola

Made for an IG follower, it's just a facemask with a piano design

<img src="https://github.com/juanmv94/Spark-AR/blob/main/otrosTerminados/Pianola/Captura.PNG?raw=true">

## PrettyLove

Made for an IG follower, it features 3D horns and 3D text "Pretty Love"

<img src="https://github.com/juanmv94/Spark-AR/blob/main/otrosTerminados/PrettyLove/Captura.PNG?raw=true">

## Soap (word soup / word search puzzle)

This was a response to the Meta Spark community official account when they posted a word search challenge, and I, instead of solving it, implemented an AR experience that was able to solve **any** word search automatically

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e4919a6-4b91-4b92-8615-a047c646356c

## SpanishLight

This filter was made as a joke between friends. It turns the user into the former dictator of Spain, Francisco Franco facing the sun in a humorous tone. The realistic light effect is made in the same way as [LightProjector](#lightprojector)

It was not published since many users could have feel ofended by the filter despite being done in a humorous tone

<img src="https://github.com/juanmv94/Spark-AR/blob/main/otrosTerminados/SpanishLight/Captura.PNG?raw=true">

## Thanos

This filter makes the user become Thanos, with face deformation, face mask, segmentation painting, and 3 diferent background to choose from.

It was not published since it didn't meet my personal quality criteria at the time I've made it (even though it doesn't look that bad)

<img src="https://github.com/juanmv94/Spark-AR/blob/main/otrosTerminados/Thanos/Captura.PNG?raw=true">

## TikTok

This filter was done just to demonstrate on TikTok that as a filter creator I can create my own personalized experiences. Watch the demo here: https://www.tiktok.com/@juanmv94/video/6745190105561976070

## VOX

This filter is a quick one made from the *Boxing Game* Meta Spark Studio template, made as a joke between friends. On it, you must "save Spain" by punching all VOX (Far-right political party) "enemies"

## Wifon

Just a variation of [FloatingPic](#floatingpic) with wifon.fm logo and music that was intended to be given to the radio station IG for free

## cellularUV

Makes a weird cellular UV effect to the camera

It was not published since I though it was too simple to make a filter from it

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5053771f-b4b3-406a-87b0-d4e60374aaff

## coche

Drive your own RC car on AR! This was done just as a tech demo so it misses lots of details. Watch the demo here: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/LI9wACQ30OI

## colorexpert

This filter shows the pixel HSL and RGB values for any XY position on the camera using shader. Might be used to debug some filters like [ColorChanger](#colorchanger)

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f503d33f-e0b6-4d3f-a2fb-ca175398d53f

## nombres

These filters were a request from 2 friends that requested one AR filter showing their names made from diferent UV circles, and I've made them in a cute/creepy way

## reina

This filter was made as a flirting tool that I really didn't had the chance to use :') It features a shining person effect using segmentation, a background text, and a 3D crown

<img src="https://github.com/juanmv94/Spark-AR/blob/main/otrosTerminados/reina/Captura.PNG?raw=true">

# My test-lab filters (otrosPruebas)

Just some kind of experiments or tech-demo projects. Nothing special to comment here

# Utils and more

Some utils made for myself (and others) for my Meta Spark dev days :)

## Windows

Specific utils for Windows versions of Meta Spark

### EnableDevMode.bat

Become a VIP Meta Spark creator by enabling developer mode, allowing you among other things to enable WIP Meta Spark functionalities (**Gatekeepers**) that were still reserved to Meta developers and not made public yet. If you were wondering, "**Skylight**" is the internal codename for **Meta Spark Studio** application

### DisableDevModeAndGKS.bat

If app starts to crash or do unexpected things after enabling 999 Gatekeepers for unreleased functionalities that you don't even know what they are, run this script to restore your "Skylight" application to stock and become part of the plebs again

### SparkAr and Lens on Win7

Believe it or not, SparkAR and Lens Studio can be run in Windows 7/8

The repository for this project was made public and can be found [here](https://github.com/juanmv94/SparkAR-And-Lens-On-Win7)

## Blocks

### Smoothscroll

Kinetic scrolling implemented on MetaSpark, whoa!

With this block, used on some of my projects like [Vegas](#vegas) and [InfluencerNews](#influencernews) you can implement kinetic scrolling, that is something no other developer was able to implement at the time on Meta Spark

### KeyboardBlock

My own 3D Keyboard block, used on [LEDStar](#ledstar)

### QRCode

QRCode block is a block based on my [QRFace](#qrface) filter that allows you to generate dynamic text QR codes inside Meta Spark. This block was made public since anyone else in the Meta Spark community was able to implement something like this, and can be found [here](https://github.com/juanmv94/SparkAR-QRCode)

## Projects

### FaceTrackingRecording

Widely used by an huge amount of creators, FaceTrackingRecording was made public long time ago becoming a success, and can be found [here](https://github.com/juanmv94/SparkAR-FaceTrackingRecording)

It allows you to make deepfake filters where you can place your face on top of another face from a video in realtime

### ExtractFace

It allows you to extract a facemask texture from a person to apply it on top of other person's face. It was used, for example, on the [Thanos](#thanos) filter

## Patches

### Blur

A fast blur patch, that works much faster than the official Meta Spark one keeping the framerate on older devices

### DotMatrix1ch

Not sure if this was made by me or someone else. It's just a dot pattern shader patch

### FPS

FPS meter patch for debugging purposes

### res

Patch for changing resolution / pixelate textures

### SDFHeart

You had SDF Polygon, SDF Star,... And now you have SDF Heart ❤

## Shaders

### colours

Really cool unused colors shader

### testnoise

Unused noise shader with similar results to [BadSignal](#badsignal)

### testcrt

Unused CRT effect shader with similar results to [OldTV](#oldtv)

### dubstep

Really cool unused procedural background

### median

Unused median shader (slow on some devices)

### cellular

Cellular shader

### bio

Unused shader that emulates some kind of... biologic thing

### Progress

Shader that shows a circular progress bar. Used in some of my effects like [PokyQuiz](#pokyquiz)

## Scripts

### rSwitch

Very useful, and widely used in my script projects, it implements a reactive switch made of Reactive *ifThenElse* operations using recursion

### galleryTex2Scr

Very useful, and widely used in my script projects, it scalates galleryTexture media to screen ratio and allows to scroll it to the desired position

### countdown

Implements a countdown timer to an specific date, like new year or Meta Spark discontinuation date

## Utilities

### SparkARVersioner

A Java application with GUI that used to change the *.arproj / *.arexport internal version number, so older versions of SparkAR were sometimes able to open projects made with later SparkAR versions. It only worked on the first SparkAR project versions.

### fixoldpicker.py

A drag-and-drop Python script to fix option picker from old projects after upgrading to latest project versions. This is due to a bug in Meta Spark Studio when upgrading projects caused by option picker being upgraded with a variadic number of inputs version, when it used to have a fixed number of inputs in the past

Just drag and drop .patches file into the script, and it will become fixed
